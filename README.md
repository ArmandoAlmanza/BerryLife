# Welcome to Berry Life

this is a simple social network to improve my skills with js(this time i wanted to try vue) and rust (i'm using actix-web)

## Use the project

```sh
cd (path of the folder that you want the project)


git clone https://github.com/ArmandoAlmanza/berry-life.git
```

Then you only need to run the docker-compose (if you don't find the docker file that means i do'nt added yet jajaja)

```sh
cd berry-life

docker-compose up
```
